    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",

    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "I will try a Naive Bayes, a KNN, and a Random Forest classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes: For this section I refer to this excellent [blog post](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/09/naive-bayes-explained/) from *analyticsvidhya.com* for supporting my arguments.\n",
    "* The most cited application for Naive Bayes is probably using it as a spam-filter\n",
    "* Pros: It is fast. It converges quickly. No curse of dimensionality.\n",
    "* Cons: Not competitive for large datasets. If independece assumption is violated it might perfrom poorly. For numerical features it assumes the normal distribution which is another strong assumption on top of the independence assumption. If categorical variable has a category (in test data set), which was not observed in training data set, then model will assign a 0 (zero) probability and will be unable to make a prediction. \n",
    "* Naive Bayes might perform well as it does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality. We have a 103-dimensional feature space and less than 40K observations. Hence, I also want to give a fast converging estimator a try. Moreover, I expect the categorical feature to be more important than the numerical features. This might counterbalance potential problems from the additional distribution assumption for numerical features.\n",
    "\n",
    "KNN. For this section I refer to this nice [material](https://www.ethz.ch/content/dam/ethz/special-interest/gess/computational-social-science-dam/documents/education/Spring2015/datascience/K-Nearest-Neighbour-Classifier.pdf) from the *ETH Zurich* for supporting my arguments.\n",
    "* Simple recommendation engine (e.g. \"users which liked the movies you watched, also like ...\").\n",
    "* Pros: It is simple to implement and use, it is robust to noisy data by averaging k-nearest neighbours, and as its classification is based solely on local information the decision boundaries can be of arbitrary shapes\n",
    "* Cons: It suffers from the curse of dimensionality. Holding the number of observations fixed and increasing the number of features (i.e. increasing the dimension of the feature space) large distances can be dominatedby irrelevant attributes. Furthermore, it is more expensive to classify a new instance than with a model\n",
    "* I expect KNN to be a good candidate for the data since its predictions is based on local information. I expect similar feature-values (i.e. observations that are located close to each other in the feature space) to exhibit similar probability of income=1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest. For this section I refer to this excellent [blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-random-forest-algorithm-d457d499ffcd) from *towardsdatascience.com* for supporting my arguments.\n",
    "* Random forest are widely used in varios fields. One example from finance is forecasting stock prices.\n",
    "* Pros: It's hyperparameters are easy to understand and easy to tune. Default values for hyperparamters usually imply already quite good results. Not prone to overfitting (if number of trees is suffienctly high). It’s easy to access relative feature importance.\n",
    "* Cons: It's slow in creating predictions (if number of trees is high) this makes it inefficient for realtime tasks. Moreover, as it is based on bootstrapping data it performs poorly on rare outcomes. Those rare outcomes will only appear in few bootstraps and hence the majority-vote of trees might remove any impact from them.\n",
    "* I expect random forest to perfrom well as it uually performs very good on \"standard\" datasets (i.e. I do not expect any important rare outcomes, the dataset provides an adequate number of oservations for training). Furthermore, the shortcoming that random forest might be slow in creating predictions should not matter in this situation."

    " * Random Forest vs KNN: Although, KNN did perform quite well, the Random Forest classifier was better than KNN in every dimension for all sample sizes except sample size 1%. Random Forest was faster in training, faster in predicting, it was more accurate, and also achieved a higher F-score. Only for sample size 1% KNN produced a higher F-score and a similar accuracy. A sample size of 1% corresponds to 361 training points. If CharityML can only collect a low number of training points for its potential donors, KNN might be the better option. However if collecting >3610 training points is not too costly the Random Forest is the model of choice.\n",

    " * Naive Bayes vs Other (Random Forest or KNN): Naive Bayes was much faster than the other models in training, however its performance is closer to the naive benchmark that always predicts income=1 with 24% accuracy and an F-score of 0.2872 than to the perofrmance of the other models which feature much higher accuracy and F-scores. In this setting of identifying potential donors for CharityML, training-time and prediction-time should only be secondary. Hence, Naive Bayes can be rejected.\n",
    "\n",
    "If collecting sufficient training data is not too costly I recommend deploying the Random Forest classifier. Generally, Random Forests work well if there are many features and many observations. If the number of observations drops it might be beneficial to switch to KNN. Another advantage of Random Forest vs. KNN is that Random Forest can be used to analyze feature importance and hence it might also help CharityML to generate some additional useful information about their potential donors."

    "Random Forests are built on decision trees. A Random Forest generates random samples with replacement from the original training data. This means it draws random points from the training set (the same point may be drwan multiple times) and generates a new training set from these points. This process is repeated multiple times. This produces multiple new training sets. Next the Random Forest fits a Tree to each of these new training sets. The final Random Forest classifier constitutes the aggregation of these Trees. For predicting whether a new potential donor might have income>50K it answers with \"yes\" if the majority of Trees answer with \"yes\". Otherwise, if the majority of Trees predict \"no\" then the Random Forest will answer with \"no\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Trees are very powerful. However, their major drawback is instability (by changing the training set only a little the corresponding Tree might change drastically) and high tendency for overfitting (this means they just learn the training data by heart and do not identify general patterns that generalize well on unseen data). Random Forests turn the instability of Trees into an advantage and overcome the tendency of overfitting by aggregating a great variety of different Trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "As pointed out above, Random Forests are generally very efficient for most \"moderate\" machine learning tasks where you neither have millions of pictures to learn from and would expect better performance by a well tuned neural net, nor have very few datapoints and a strong functional dependency between the target and just a few feature variables which should probably be tackled by a linear model with polynomial feature preprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, fitting Random Forest classifier constitutes a solid choice for the data at hand."

    "I presume the following ranking of featur importance (from top1 to top5): occupation, age, education_level, hours-per-week, sex.\n",
    "\n",
    "Occupation is the most explicit information about the actual job. I believe the job is a better predictor of wage than other personal characteristics. Therefore I rank it at the top. Workclass seems to constitute a higher aggregate of occupation. After controlling for occupation, workclass should not be too important. Hence I skip this feature. \n",
    "\n",
    "The wage of two persons in the same job, will differ most strongly with seniority (I expect). Age might be a good indicator for seniorits. Hence I choose it second. \n",
    "\n",
    "The wage of two persons in the job with identical seniority, will differ most strongly with eduction (I expect). Hence, I choose education_level third. I believe education_level to be more important than education-num, because education-num fixes the ratio of different education levels, while education_num allows the model to allocate different weights to every level during fitting. However, in the chunk below I expect education-num to be of higher importance, as this feature is not splittet into many features by preprocessing the data. Anyways, after controlloing for education_level, the feature education-num will only provide minor additional infromation. Hence, I skip this feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "The wage of two persons in the same job with identical seniority and identical education_level with differ most strongly in working time (I expect). Actually I expect working time to be even more important than seniority or eductaion level. If two persons work in the same job, one fulltime and one only part-time (lets say 50%). Then I would expect the wage of the fulltime worker to be higher than the wage of the part-time worker even if the part-time worker has higher seniority. Hence, if the dataset was balanced w.r.t. to the feature hours-per-week I would rank it higher than number four. However, I expect this feature to have almost the same value for most observations (around 40 weekly hours) and to vary only for a minority. On this minority this feature will be important. However as it does not provide a meaningfull differentiation for the majority of observations it will be less important for the overall dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "After controlling for job, seniority, eductaion level, and working hours, I belief sex to be the next feature concerning feature importance. Two identical candidates in jobinterviews might get the same job at different sallaries depending on how aggressively they bargain for a high wage. Possibly, females bargain less aggressively and land lower sallaries. This is obviously highly speculative. But who knows. Anyways, many surveys show that - ceteris paribus - females are landing lower wages than males."

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* From the five features I ranked above, `age` and `hours_per_week` are contained in the top5-features from the random forest. I also gave a high rank to `education_level`, the ranom forest did pick `education-num`. Concening the informative value they carry I consider them a susbtitute. However, `education_level` is split into many features by one hot encoding before being used for training, while `education-num` enters training directly. Hence, after preprocessing `education-num` ranks higher.\n",
    "* I was somewhat close. I picked 2.5 features correctly (if `education-num` counts semi-correct, considering I picked `education_level`). The features `age` and `hours_per_week` are indeed important features. This is what I expected as outlined above.\n",
    "* Considering myself successful at 2.5 features, means at the same time I missed 2.5 features. I have to admit I'm most surprised by the feature `marital-status_Married-civ-spouse`. This feature contains only part of the information of the original feature `marital-status`and I did not even expect the original feature to be important. The importance of this feature has to possible explanations: either being married is significantly positively correlated with high wages, or it is significantly negatively correlated with high wages. Checking this out in the chunk below, reveals that 46% of those individuals with status `marital-status_ Married-civ-spouse` are earning more than 50K USD. Of those individuals with different status than `marital-status_ Married-civ-spouse` only 7% earn more than 50K USD. I certainly did not expect such a strong impact. This showcases the advantage of using the feature importance method. I'm also surprised that `capital-gain` ranks before `education-num`. However, I do not find that equally impressive, as `capital-gain` has not been split up into different features before being used for training."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "Restricting the data to the top5-features reduces accuracy from 0.8442 to 0.8343, and f-score from 0.6855 to 0.6646. At the same time the reduced model needs less training time. Neither the reduced performance, nor the improvement of training time seem to be overly significant. But as always: it depends. If, for some reason, you need to train the model realtime for answering some realtime-requests with yes/no. Suppose you need to do this millions of times a day and for every correct response you get some margin of whatever deal is going on in the background (AdTech, stock market). This is your business. The non-reduced model times out 80% of the time. The reduced model times out only 10% of the time. Then switching to the reduced model will multiply your return. This leverages the seemingly insignificant difference to a very significant difference. Ofcourse this works also the other way around. Suppose the financial market is not able to achieve better performance than the reduced model and you are the only player that achieves one percentage point better accuracy, 84.4% instead of 83.4%. Than this can be leveraged to a significant advantage in competition."
